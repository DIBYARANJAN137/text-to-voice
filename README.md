Got it! Here are four key bullet points for your *README* file based on your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based Text-to-Speech converter:  

- Overview: A simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert typed text into speech using the browser's built-in SpeechSynthesis API.   
- How to Use: Enter text in the input box, select a voice, adjust settings (if needed), and click the "Speak" button to hear the output. No external libraries required!
